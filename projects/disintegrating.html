	<h4>
	Disintegrating the Wall consists of a landmark that degenerates the intrusive wall that
currently divides the American/Mexican border and introduces an environment of
union and resilience that rises against the segregative movement of the present day.
This physical intervention is the heart of a bi-national space as well as a vehicular and
pedestrian crossing between Nogales, AZ and Nogales, MEX. Green and gathering
spaces construct the path towards “the landmark,” a deconstructed façade that
resembles a series of “disintegrating pixels.” An abstract expression of how a wall should
be unbuilt. In this habitable space families that’ve been separated are given the
opportunity to reunite and gather in a setting that invites both communities to a unique
opportunity, come together as one to share their cultures and vision for the border
region. It hosts a series of exhibits of the border life, including art and displays that
narrate the effects of having a wall dividing these two nations on economic, social and
environmental matters. As individuals that’ve always lived in the border region, it’s
devastating to witness the increasingly efforts by bureaucrats to divide us, and it has
become clear, the importance of demonstrating our opposition against this movement
of separation.
