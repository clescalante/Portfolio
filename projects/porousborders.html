    <h2>Porous Borders</h2>

   
    <h1>
  The conventional book space consists of structures developed around systems that offer reliability to the reader. 

  <br>
     &nbsp;

      <br>

If these methods for displaying graphic/forms throughout a book are analyzed and questioned, a book and its content, can then be released from their traditional formal implications and characteristics; leading to the development of alternative methods for displaying and reading through such medium's content/information, transforming the way in which one interacts and perceives this object.

<br>
 &nbsp;

      <br>
Borders: If the book is analyzed in terms of borders, where traditionally information/form does not cross through them and the page is seen as a metaphorical border where a two-dimensional form must exist in its whole essence. How could this relationship between a two-dimensional form and its three-dimensional medium (book space) be subverted?
