    <h2>Disintegrating the Wall</h2>

  

    <h1>
      Disintegrating the Wall consists of a landmark that degenerates the intrusive wall that
      currently divides the American/Mexican border and introduces an environment of
      union and resilience that rises against the segregative movement of the present day.
      This physical intervention is the heart of a bi-national space as well as a vehicular and
      pedestrian crossing between Nogales, AZ and Nogales, MEX. Green and gathering
      spaces construct the path towards “the landmark,” a deconstructed façade that
      resembles a series of “disintegrating pixels.” An abstract expression of how a wall should
      be unbuilt. In this habitable space families that’ve been separated are given the
      opportunity to reunite and gather in a setting that invites both communities to a unique
      opportunity, come together as one to share their cultures and vision for the border
      region. It hosts a series of exhibits of the border life, including art and displays that
      narrate the effects of having a wall dividing these two nations on economic, social and
      environmental matters. As individuals that’ve always lived in the border region, it’s
      devastating to witness the increasingly efforts by bureaucrats to divide us, and it has
      become clear, the importance of demonstrating our opposition against this movement
      of separation.
