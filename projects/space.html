    <h2>Porous Borders III</h2>

  

    <h1>
     When graphic/forms are displayed inside an enclosed space, such graphic/forms tend to be displayed as two-dimensional representations throughout the surfaces of the room. For this particular case, the characteristics that entail the borders, have another level of complexity; one can say that the physicality of such surfaces, serve as the borders, which  dictate the areas where a two-dimensional form must be displayed completely in order to be read/understood. 

If the conventional methods for displaying graphic/forms throughout an enclosed space are analyzed/questioned, they can then be released from their traditional formal implications and characteristics; leading to the development of alternative methods for displaying and reading through content displayed in this format, transforming the way in which one interacts and perceives information within a space.
